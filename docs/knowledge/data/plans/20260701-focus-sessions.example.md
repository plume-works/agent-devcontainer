# Focus sessions

_Example document — this shows the full body template of a shipped plan,
including the `## Spec changes` section the ship skill synced before flipping
the status to done. The setup skill deletes `_.example.md` files after
onboarding.*

## Context

Pomodux has a window and a session log but no working timer. This plan builds
the core loop: countdown, pause/resume, completion logging. The
[state model](../architecture/state-model.example) (single store, append-only
log) is already in place.

## Approach

A pure timer engine driven by a monotonic clock, decoupled from the UI: the
engine emits state transitions, the store reduces them, the UI renders the
store. Completion appends to the session log through the existing writer.

## Implementation Steps

### Task 1: Timer engine

**Files:** Create: `src/timer/engine.ts`, `src/timer/engine.test.ts`

- [x] Countdown state machine (idle → running → paused → completed/abandoned)
- [x] Monotonic elapsed-time computation
- [x] Unit tests for every transition

### Task 2: Store and log integration

**Files:** Modify: `src/store/sessions.ts`, `src/store/reducers.ts`

- [x] Reduce engine transitions into store state
- [x] Append completed and abandoned sessions to the log
- [x] Discard sessions shorter than one minute

### Task 3: UI wiring

**Files:** Create: `src/ui/timer-view.tsx`; Modify: `src/ui/tray.ts`

- [x] Main-window countdown display with start/pause/resume/abandon
- [x] Tray controls mirroring the window
- [x] Completion chime

## Spec changes

[Timer](../spec/timer.example) — session countdown, pause/resume, and wall-clock
independence requirements written from this plan's behavior.

## Verification

- `npm test` — engine transitions and reducer coverage green.
- Manual: 25-minute session with a mid-session pause completes and appears in
  the history log; abandoning logs with the `abandoned` flag.

## Out of scope

- Break timers and long-break scheduling.
- The streak widget (planned separately).

## Key references

Verified anchor points (line numbers as of 2026-07-01):

- `src/store/sessions.ts:15` — `appendSession()`, the log writer
- `src/main.ts:31` — window/tray bootstrap where the view mounts

*Convention notes: `status: done` requires `completed` (schema-enforced), and
the plan's link in the plans hub sits under `## Done`. `## Spec changes` names
every spec this work touches — the ship skill walks that list before the status
flips, which is what keeps specs from drifting.*
