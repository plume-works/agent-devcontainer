# 🧭 Codebase

*The map of the code as it actually is — written only by reading the code, never
from memory. The map mirrors the code's containment tree: one doc per component
(crate, package, module) at a canonical key matching its source path, children
linked from their parent's `## Contains` — so `iwe tree -k data/codebase`
renders the component tree. Every doc carries `source` (the code it describes),
`commit` (the git revision it was read at), and `verified` (the date); code
newer than `commit` means the doc is suspect — refresh it. Division of truth:
spec/ is what must be, architecture/ is why it's shaped this way, this hub is
what is.*

## Getting around

*Filled when you map the codebase: how to build, run, and test; the entry
points; a directory → component table.*

## Components

## Flows

## Interfaces

*External surfaces — HTTP APIs, CLI commands, storage formats, IPC contracts —
one doc each, keyed `api-<name>`.*
