# Timer

_Example document — this shows the shape of a behavioral spec:
`### Requirement:` sections with SHALL statements, each backed by
`#### Scenario:` WHEN/THEN examples concrete enough to test. The setup skill
deletes `_.example.md` files after onboarding.*

How the Pomodux countdown timer must behave. This is the durable truth the
implementation is checked against; when a shipped plan changes timer behavior,
this document is updated in the same change.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Session countdown

The timer SHALL count down a focus session of the configured length and end it
with a completion signal, independent of UI state.

#### Scenario: Starting a focus session

- **WHEN** the user starts a focus session with a 25-minute setting
- **THEN** the timer counts down from 25:00 and fires the completion signal at
  00:00
- **AND** the completion is recorded even if the window is closed or minimized

### Requirement: Pause and resume

The timer SHALL pause and resume without losing elapsed time.

#### Scenario: Resuming a paused session

- **GIVEN** a session paused at 12:34 remaining
- **WHEN** the user resumes
- **THEN** the countdown continues from 12:34

### Requirement: Wall-clock independence

Elapsed time SHALL be computed from a monotonic clock, so system sleep, timezone
changes, or manual clock adjustments never corrupt a session.

#### Scenario: Laptop sleeps mid-session

- **GIVEN** a running session with 10:00 remaining
- **WHEN** the machine sleeps for an hour and wakes
- **THEN** the session is either completed (if configured to run through sleep)
  or paused at 10:00 — never showing negative or drifted time

*Convention notes: specs carry no frontmatter — they are reference, not work
items. The requirement headers are stable names other documents cite: the
[timer drift bug](../bugs/timer-drift-after-sleep.example) reports a violation
of "Wall-clock independence", and the
[focus sessions plan](../plans/20260701-focus-sessions.example) lists this spec
under its `## Spec changes`. Scale rigor with risk — a two-line requirement is
fine for low-risk behavior.*
