# Xpra Setup Role

This Ansible role installs Xpra, xpra-html5, VirtualGL, and related dependencies for remote desktop and application streaming on Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble).

## Overview

Xpra is a persistent remote application server that allows you to run X11 applications on a remote host and display them locally. This role sets up:

- **Xpra**: Remote desktop and application streaming server
- **xpra-html5**: HTML5 client for web-based access
- **VirtualGL**: GPU acceleration for remote rendering
- **Mesa utilities**: Software rendering fallback (llvmpipe)
- **Xvfb**: Virtual framebuffer for headless operation

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 24.04 (Noble) or compatible Debian-based distribution
- Internet access to download packages from official repositories
- Root or sudo access

## Role Variables

### `install_xpra`

- **Type**: Boolean
- **Default**: `false`
- **Description**: Enable or disable the installation of Xpra and related packages

## Example Usage

```yaml
- name: Install Xpra
  hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    install_xpra: true
  roles:
    - { role: xpra_setup, tags: ['xpra_setup'] }
```

Or with conditional installation:

```yaml
- name: Setup Docker image with optional Xpra
  hosts: all
  become: true
  roles:
    - { role: xpra_setup, tags: ['xpra_setup'] }
```

Then enable at runtime:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e "install_xpra=true"
```

## What Gets Installed

### Xpra Repository Setup and Packages

This role uses the official Xpra `setup.py` helper from the Xpra GitHub
repository with the `install-lts-repo` command to set up the Xpra APT
repository. That step handles:

- Adding the Xpra GPG key
- Adding the correct APT repository for the current distribution
- Updating the APT cache

After the repository is configured, the role installs the following
packages via APT:

- `xpra` - Main Xpra server and client (installed from the Xpra APT repository)
- `xpra-html5` - HTML5 web client (installed by cloning the xpra-html5 repository and installing it via `setup.py`)

### From GitHub Releases

- `virtualgl` - pinned with per-architecture SHA-256 in `defaults/main.yml`

### From Ubuntu Repositories

- `mesa-utils` - OpenGL utilities
- `libgl1` - OpenGL runtime
- `libglvnd0` - OpenGL vendor library
- `xvfb` - Virtual framebuffer
- `libgl1-mesa-dri` - Software rendering support (Mesa DRI with llvmpipe)

## Idempotency

This role is idempotent. Running it multiple times will not cause issues:

- Repository files are overwritten (safe)
- Package installations are idempotent
- VirtualGL version and checksums are pinned for deterministic installs

## Architecture Support

The role automatically detects the system architecture and downloads the appropriate VirtualGL package:

- **amd64** (x86_64)
- **arm64** (aarch64)

## Notes

- The role requires internet access to download packages from official repositories
- VirtualGL version and checksums are pinned in `tasks/main.yml`
- The role uses `install_recommends: false` to minimize image size
- All tasks are conditional on `install_xpra` variable for flexibility
