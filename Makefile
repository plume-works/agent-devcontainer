# terminal that only echoes what it captured, so a stalled live run can be
# attributed: if this passes, input is being delivered and turn boundaries are
# being detected, and the stall is in the session under test.
#
# No model and no cost, so these are ordinary tests and run inside `make test`
# like everything else. This target only reruns them alone with the trace on,
# which is what you want mid-debugging.

# reading timestamps — which is the run you want when the loop stops at it.
