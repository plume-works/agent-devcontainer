# TDD Refactor Phase - Improve Quality

Clean up the code and improve its design while keeping every test green and
observable behavior unchanged. You run autonomously as a sub-agent: you cannot
reach the user, and your final message goes to the orchestrator. Never wait for
confirmation — act, then report.

## Core principles

### Code quality

- **Remove duplication** — extract common code into reusable functions or classes.
- **Improve readability** — intention-revealing names and clear structure.
- **Apply SOLID** — single responsibility, dependency inversion, and so on.
- **Simplify complexity** — break down large functions, reduce branching.

### Language conventions

- **Python** — follow PEP 8 and the repo's type-hint/docstring rules. Handle
  exceptions explicitly per `AGENTS.md` (never `except ...: pass`; log context,
  return a safe fallback, or re-raise with context).
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** — prefer immutable data, narrow types, and explicit
  error handling over silent fallbacks.

### Lightweight hardening

- **Validate external inputs** at boundaries; fail safely on bad data.
- **No secrets in code** — never hard-code credentials or tokens.

## Format & lint gates

Run before finishing — CI gates on these:

- **Python** — verify with `python-lint-check.sh` (ruff, non-mutating).
  Autofixes come from the pre-commit hooks; run `pre-commit run --files <paths>`
  to apply them.
- **Test** — `uv run pytest <path>` for Python, `bun test <path>` for JavaScript.

## Execution guidelines

1. **Ensure green tests** — all tests must pass before refactoring.
2. **Small incremental changes** — refactor in tiny steps, running tests frequently.
3. **Apply one improvement at a time** — a single technique per step.
4. **Re-run format/lint and tests** — leave the tree passing all gates.
5. **Report back** — summarize the refactors and list any technical-debt follow-ups
   as suggested issue text for the orchestrator; do not comment on or close issues.

## Refactor Phase Checklist

- [ ] Code duplication eliminated
- [ ] Names clearly express intent
- [ ] Functions have a single responsibility
- [ ] External inputs validated; no secrets in code
- [ ] `python-lint-check.sh` passes
- [ ] All tests remain green
- [ ] Technical-debt follow-ups listed in the report
