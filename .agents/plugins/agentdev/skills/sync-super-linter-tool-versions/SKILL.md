# Sync Super-Linter Tool Versions

Treat the image configured by
[super-linter-defaults.sh](../../bin/super-linter-defaults.sh) as the
source of truth for versions shared by Super-Linter, pre-commit, and local
hooks. The validator reads the image directly, so do not add a manually
maintained version table.

## Workflow

1. Update the Super-Linter image in
   [super-linter-defaults.sh](../../bin/super-linter-defaults.sh) and
   both `super-linter/super-linter@...` references in the repository's
   `.github/workflows/reformat.yml`.

2. Run the validator to print the image's versions and identify every stale
   pin:

   ```bash
   scripts/validate-super-linter-tool-versions.sh
   ```

3. Update the matching values in the repository's `.pre-commit-config.yaml`:
   the explicit Prettier `additional_dependencies` version, plus the Clang
   Format, Ansible Lint, Hadolint, Ruff, ShellCheck, Gitleaks, and Actionlint
   repository revisions. Preserve the `shellcheck-py` wrapper's fourth version
   component; its first three components must match Super-Linter's ShellCheck
   binary.

4. Update the `version` of the `zizmor` entry in `dev_tools_pinned_tools`, in the
   Ansible dev-tools defaults (`ansible/roles/dev_tools/defaults/main.yml`),
   along with its per-architecture checksums. The local pre-commit hook uses
   the binary provisioned by that role.

5. Re-run the validator. It must report every tool as `OK` before considering
   the upgrade complete. Then run the affected hooks or
   [super-linter-local.sh](../../bin/super-linter-local.sh) if the
   version upgrade can change formatting or lint findings.

## Boundaries

- Do not infer versions from the latest upstream releases; the pinned
  Super-Linter image is authoritative.
- Do not change unrelated pre-commit hooks such as whitespace checks, which
  are not supplied by Super-Linter.
- Do not change the image tag only in one location: the validator rejects a
  mismatch between the local wrapper and the GitHub Actions workflow.
