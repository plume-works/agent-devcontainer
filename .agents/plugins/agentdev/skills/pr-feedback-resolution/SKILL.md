# Resolve PR Feedback

Systematic approach to resolving all PR feedback including review comments, CI failures, security findings, and coverage gaps.

## When to Use This Skill

- Address code review comments on pull requests
- Fix failing CI checks (tests, lint, build, formatting)
- Resolve CodeQL security findings
- Improve Codecov patch coverage
- Respond to reviewer questions
- Update code, tests, and thread replies based on feedback
- NEVER post work summary as PR title or body.
- Do not edit PR title/body unless explicitly requested or the user asks for a PR refresh.

## Prerequisites

- Active pull request with feedback
- Access to `gh` for PR details, with GitHub MCP only as a fallback when `gh`
  is missing or unauthenticated
- Access to CI logs and test results via the [extract-github-actions-logs](../extract-github-actions-logs/) skill
- Access to CodeQL security scan results via the [get-codeql-data](../get-codeql-data/) skill
- Access to Codecov reports
- `jq` for safe filtering of the paginated GraphQL output

## When to Delegate

Classify the requested change by artifact before delegating:

| Change type                 | Examples                                                                                                                                  | Handling                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime executable behavior | Application/library/CLI code in Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, shell, or C++                                                              | Delegate feature, bug-fix, and critical-logic implementation to the Principal Engineer, which applies TDD when the behavior can be exercised by an automated test.                            |
| Non-executable artifact     | Documentation, Markdown, configuration, manifests, CI workflows, lockfiles, templates, prompts, agent definitions, and skill instructions | Edit directly. Do not invoke the TDD agents or create behavioral tests solely for the artifact; run its existing formatter, linter, parser, schema, syntax, or repository validation instead. |
| Mixed change                | A runtime code change plus docs, configuration, or workflow updates                                                                       | Split the work: delegate only the runtime executable behavior, and handle the non-executable artifacts directly with artifact-specific validation.                                            |

- **Never invoke** tdd-red, tdd-green, or tdd-refactor agents directly—the
  Principal Engineer handles them when the runtime-code gate above is met.
- **Research before implementing**: use the built-in `Explore` agent when blocked on understanding requirements or locating code.
- **Plan before implementing**: use the built-in `Plan` agent for complex multi-step remediation.
- Do not infer that a changed artifact needs a new test merely because the repository
  has a test suite. Tests must exercise executable behavior, not duplicate static
  document, configuration, or workflow contents.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Collect All Feedback Sources

Gather complete context before making changes.

1. **Fetch PR review comments**:

```bash
mkdir -p ./.tmp
gh api graphql --paginate --slurp \
  -f owner='<owner>' -f name='<repo>' -F number=<pr-number> \
  -f query='query($owner: String!, $name: String!, $number: Int!, $endCursor: String) {
    repository(owner: $owner, name: $name) {
      pullRequest(number: $number) {
        reviewThreads(first: 100, after: $endCursor) {
          nodes {
            id isResolved
            comments(first: 100) {
              pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
              nodes { id databaseId body author { login } url createdAt }
            }
          }
          pageInfo { hasNextPage endCursor }
        }
      }
    }
  }' > ./.tmp/pr-<pr-number>-review-thread-pages.json
```

    This query retains each opaque review-thread `id` and paginates every
    thread page. For any returned thread whose `comments.pageInfo.hasNextPage`
    is true, query that specific thread with `node(id: $thread)` and
    `comments(first: 100, after: $endCursor)` until `hasNextPage` is false;
    append the pages before classifying the thread. Do not silently treat the
    first 100 comments as complete feedback. `gh pr view <pr-number>
    --comments` is insufficient because it flattens comments and omits thread
    resolution metadata.

After fetching, **filter out resolved threads** using these rules (apply in order):

- **Skip if GitHub-resolved**: If a review thread is marked as resolved on GitHub, exclude the entire thread — do not process any comments in it.
- **Skip if last comment signals completion**: Treat the thread as resolved and skip it entirely only if the last comment clearly and positively signals completion using a case-insensitive whole-word or whole-phrase match on terms like "done", "complete", "fixed", "addressed", "ignore", "wontfix", "won't fix", "LGTM", or "no action needed". Do not treat the thread as resolved if the term appears inside another word such as "prefixed" or in an obviously negative or uncertain context near the term such as "not fixed yet", "still not addressed", "is this fixed?", or "doesn't look done".
- **Override with last-comment instructions**: If the last comment in an unresolved thread contains explicit instructions (e.g., "instead do X", "use Y here", "change this to Z"), treat those instructions as the authoritative user intent for that thread and ignore earlier comments in the thread.

2. **Get CI check results**:
   - Check GitHub Actions workflow runs
   - Use the [extract-github-actions-logs](../extract-github-actions-logs/) skill to fetch job logs and download uploaded test-report artifacts
   - Review lint/format check outputs
   - Check build logs for errors

3. **Get CodeQL security findings**:
   - Use the [get-codeql-data](../get-codeql-data/) skill to fetch PR-scoped or repository-scoped CodeQL alerts with `gh api`
   - Review severity and CWE classifications
   - Note file locations and line numbers

4. **Get Codecov patch coverage**:
   - Access Codecov report for PR
   - Identify uncovered lines in diff
   - Note files with low coverage

5. **Document evidence links**:
   - Save URLs to all review threads
   - Save CI run URLs
   - Save CodeQL finding URLs
   - Save Codecov report URL

### Workflow 2: Classify Review Comment Intent

Determine confidence level before making changes. **Only process threads that passed the Workflow 1 filters** — resolved or completion-signaled threads are never classified.

1. **Analyze comment language**:
   - **Explicit requests**: "Change X to Y", "Add Z", "Remove A"
   - **Questions**: "Should this handle X?" (may be rhetorical)
   - **Suggestions**: "Consider using Y" (may be optional)
   - **Observations**: "This could be simpler" (may not require action)

2. **Compute confidence score**:
   - **90-100%**: Explicit change request with clear instructions
   - **70-89%**: Strong suggestion with clear direction
   - **50-69%**: Suggestion or question with unclear intent
   - **<50%**: Observation or open-ended question

3. **Decision matrix**:
   - **≥70% confidence**: Proceed with change, document rationale
   - **<70% confidence**: Reply asking for clarification, do not change code

### Workflow 3: Address Review Comments

Resolve code review feedback systematically.

1. **For each high-confidence comment (≥70%)**:
   - Validate the approach against the applicable repository conventions and the
     artifact classification above
   - For runtime executable behavior that can be exercised by an automated unit
     or integration test, delegate to the Principal Engineer and use the TDD
     cycle: write test → implement → refactor
   - For docs, configuration, workflows, metadata, and other non-executable
     artifacts, make the smallest direct change and run the artifact's existing
     validation; do not add a test just to create a TDD cycle
   - Link commit/change to specific review comment
   - Reply in the thread, verify the change, then resolve only that exact
     thread ID. Never resolve a thread merely because a commit exists:

     ```bash
     gh api graphql -f thread='<thread-graphql-id>' -f query='mutation($thread: ID!) {
       resolveReviewThread(input: {threadId: $thread}) {
         thread { id isResolved }
       }
     }'
     ```

2. **For each low-confidence comment (<70%)**:
   - Reply in-thread with interpretation and ask for confirmation
   - Example: "I understand this as [interpretation]. Should I [proposed action]?"
   - Wait for clarification before making changes
   - Document decision in PR thread

3. **For suggested code changes**:
   - Review suggestion for correctness and style
   - Accept if it improves code quality
   - If modifying suggestion, explain why in response
   - Apply change and mark resolved

### Workflow 4: Fix CI Test Failures

Systematically resolve failing tests.

1. **Collect test output**:
   - For GitHub Actions failures, first use the [extract-github-actions-logs](../extract-github-actions-logs/) skill to:
     - fetch the failing job log with `gh run view ... --job ... --log`
     - list the run's artifacts and download any test-report or coverage artifact
   - Inspect the downloaded reports before reproducing locally.

```bash
   # Reproduce locally after reviewing CI evidence
   uv run pytest <path> -x -q
```

2. **Diagnose root cause**:
   - Read test failure messages
   - Identify failing assertion or exception
   - Trace back to code change that introduced failure
   - Determine if test expectation or implementation is wrong

3. **Fix implementation or test**:
   - If test expectation is correct: fix implementation
   - If test expectation is wrong: update test
   - If new behavior: update test expectations
   - Add regression test if bug revealed

4. **Verify fix locally**:

```bash
   uv run pytest <path>          # Python
   bun test <path>               # JavaScript / TypeScript
```

5. **Push and verify CI passes**:
   - Commit fix with descriptive message
   - Push to PR branch
   - Monitor CI for green checks

### Workflow 5: Resolve CodeQL Security Findings

Address security vulnerabilities safely.

1. **Analyze finding details**:
   - Use the [get-codeql-data](../get-codeql-data/) skill to fetch the current open alerts before planning remediation
   - Review severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
   - Understand CWE classification
   - Read CodeQL explanation and remediation guidance
   - Locate vulnerable code in source

2. **Plan remediation**:
   - Prefer minimal-risk fixes
   - Avoid introducing new vulnerabilities
   - Follow OWASP secure coding guidelines
   - Consider defense-in-depth approach

3. **Implement fix**:
   - Apply secure coding pattern
   - Validate inputs and sanitize outputs
   - Add error handling
   - Document security considerations

4. **Add security tests**:
   - Write test that would exploit vulnerability
   - Verify test fails before fix
   - Verify test passes after fix
   - Add additional edge cases

5. **Verify resolution**:
   - Re-check alerts with the [get-codeql-data](../get-codeql-data/) skill after the next scan or code scanning refresh
   - Confirm finding is resolved
   - Document fix in PR comment

### Workflow 6: Improve Patch Coverage

Add tests for uncovered code.

1. **Identify coverage gaps**:

```bash
   # From Codecov report or local coverage
   # Note uncovered line ranges in modified files
```

2. **Prioritize coverage**:
   - **Critical paths**: Business logic, error handling
   - **Edge cases**: Boundary conditions, error states
   - **Integration points**: External API calls, file I/O

3. **Write missing tests**: delegate to the Principal Engineer to run the TDD
   cycle (Red: failing test for the uncovered path; Green: make it pass;
   Refactor: improve test clarity). Do not invoke the TDD sub-agents directly.

4. **Verify coverage improvement**:

```bash
   # Keep the coverage run scoped to the affected area.
   uv run pytest <path> --cov=<module> --cov-report=term-missing
   bun test --coverage <path>
```

5. **Target coverage goal**:
   - Aim for 80%+ patch coverage minimum
   - 100% for critical business logic
   - Document untestable code with rationale

### Workflow 7: Final Verification

Ensure all feedback is addressed before requesting re-review.

1. **Checklist for completion**:
   - [ ] All review comments addressed or replied
   - [ ] Resolved comments marked as resolved
   - [ ] All CI checks passing (green)
   - [ ] No unresolved CodeQL findings
   - [ ] Patch coverage meets target (≥80%) when runtime executable code changed
   - [ ] All tests passing locally and in CI

2. **Post resolution summary** using the Feedback Resolution Summary template (see Pattern below)

3. **Decide whether a fresh AI review is needed**: resolving feedback often
   changes more than the feedback asked for, and the `ai-review-present` gate
   stays green across pushes, so nothing else raises the question. Apply
   [pr-eval-review-needed](../pr-eval-review-needed/SKILL.md) and, when it says
   yes, request the review through
   [pr-request-ai-review](../pr-request-ai-review/SKILL.md). Report the decision
   either way.

4. **Request human re-review**:
   - Tag original reviewers
   - Highlight significant changes from feedback
   - Note any items needing discussion

## Common Patterns

### Pattern: Thread Resolution Filtering

When iterating over PR review threads, apply these filters in order before any classification or action:

| Check                    | Condition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Action                                                          |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub-resolved          | Thread is marked resolved in GitHub UI                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | **Skip entire thread**                                          |
| Completion signal        | Last comment is a short, positive-only acknowledgement such as exactly "done", "complete", "fixed", "addressed", "resolved", "ignore", "wontfix", "won't fix", "LGTM", "looks good to me", "no action needed" (case-insensitive), with no trailing "but", "however", questions, or additional suggestions | **Skip entire thread**                                          |
| Last-comment instruction | Last comment contains explicit instructions (e.g., "instead do X", "use Y", "change to Z")                                                                                                                                                                                                                | **Follow last comment only**; ignore earlier comments in thread |
| Default                  | None of the above                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Process thread normally using all comments                      |

This filtering must be applied **before** computing confidence scores or taking any action.

### Pattern: Feedback Resolution Summary Template

Post this template as a PR comment after completing all work:

<!-- validate_skills: ignore-cross-reference-start -->

```markdown
## Feedback Resolution Summary

### Review Comments Addressed

- [Comment #1](link): Changed X to Y per reviewer request
- [Comment #2](link): Added error handling for edge case A
- [Comment #3](link): **Clarification requested** - awaiting response on approach

### CI Failures Fixed

- **Tests**: Fixed 3 failing tests in http_client ([logs](link))
- **Lint**: Resolved formatting issues in 5 files
- **Build**: Updated dependency declarations

### Security Findings Resolved

- **CodeQL-001**: Fixed SQL injection in query builder ([finding](link))
- **CodeQL-002**: Addressed path traversal vulnerability ([finding](link))

### Coverage Improvements

- Added tests for new request timeout logic (+15 lines covered)
- Added edge case tests for error handling (+8 lines covered)
- **Current patch coverage**: 87% (target: from Codecov report/config)

### Test Results

- All tests passing: [CI run](link)
- Coverage report: [Codecov](link)

### Files Modified

- [http_client/client.py](link): Timeout implementation
- [http_client/tests/test_client.py](link): Added timeout tests
- [http_client/types.py](link): Added timeout status field
```

<!-- validate_skills: ignore-cross-reference-end -->

Resolve only threads that were replied to and verified, using their GraphQL IDs
from the paginated collection. Do not resolve a flattened REST comment or a
completion-signaled thread that GitHub still marks unresolved.

### Pattern: Clarification Template

When comment intent is unclear (<70% confidence):

```markdown
@reviewer Thanks for the feedback! I want to make sure I understand correctly:

**My interpretation**: [Describe your understanding]

**Proposed action**: [What you plan to do]

Could you confirm if this aligns with your intent, or let me know if you had something else in mind?
```

### Pattern: Resolution Comment Template

When marking comment resolved:

```markdown
✅ Addressed in [commit SHA]

**Changes made**: [Brief description]

**Rationale**: [Why this approach was chosen]

**Verification**: [How it was tested]
```

### Pattern: CI Failure Investigation

Systematic debugging of test failures:

1. Read test output completely
2. Identify first failing assertion
3. Review code change that touched that area
4. Reproduce locally if possible
5. Fix root cause, not symptom
6. Add regression test
7. Verify all related tests still pass

### Pattern: Security Finding Response

Safe remediation of CodeQL alerts:

1. Never dismiss without fixing
2. Understand vulnerability class (CWE)
3. Research secure alternatives
4. Implement minimal-risk fix
5. Add tests that would exploit vulnerability
6. Document security considerations
7. Request security review if uncertain

## Execution Log

Maintain an internal execution log documenting:

- **Comment tracking**: Review comment URL → confidence score → action taken → resolution status
- **CI failures**: Check name → failure reason → fix applied → verification result
- **Security findings**: CodeQL ID → severity → remediation → test added
- **Coverage gaps**: File:lines → tests added → coverage delta
- **Evidence trail**: All links to commits, CI runs, comments, findings

## Quality Standards

### Code Changes

- Follow repository engineering standards
- Use the TDD cycle for changes to runtime executable behavior. Do not use TDD or
  add tests for docs, configuration, workflows, manifests, metadata, prompts, or
  other non-executable artifacts; use their native validation instead.
- Maintain or improve test coverage when runtime executable code changed
- No introduction of new technical debt
- Document non-obvious decisions
- **Safety-first**: 70% intent confidence minimum for code changes; below 70% ask for clarification
- Avoid risky refactors without explicit reviewer request
- Avoid behavior changes unless explicitly requested
- Prefer targeted, minimal diffs

### Communication

- Clear, professional, constructive tone
- Link to evidence (commits, logs, reports)
- Explain rationale for decisions
- Ask for clarification when uncertain
- Thank reviewers for feedback

### Verification

- All tests pass locally before pushing
- CI checks green before requesting re-review
- Coverage targets met
- Security findings resolved
- No regression introduced

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cannot determine comment intent

**Solution**: Reply asking for clarification with your interpretation and proposed action. Do not guess or assume.

### Problem: CI fails intermittently (flaky test)

**Solution**: Identify source of non-determinism (timing, randomness, external dependency). Fix test to be deterministic or mark as integration test.

### Problem: CodeQL false positive

**Solution**: Review carefully; often not false positive. If genuinely incorrect, document why and request CodeQL suppression approval.

### Problem: Coverage target cannot be met

**Solution**: Document why certain code is untestable (external API, hardware dependency, etc.). Consider refactoring for testability.

### Problem: Review comment asks for significant refactor

**Solution**: Assess scope vs PR goals. If out of scope, propose follow-up issue. If in scope, create plan and confirm with reviewer before proceeding.
