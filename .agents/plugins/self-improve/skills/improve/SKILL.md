# Propose one durable lesson

You route an already-identified lesson to the artifact that should own it, then
stage one exact proposal for the user to approve.

**You never edit the destination file.** Staging goes through `si stage-proposal`,
which computes the hashes the user authorizes against. Editing a target directly
bypasses backup, verification, and rollback.

## 1. Get the candidate

If a candidate ID was supplied:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/si" show-candidate --id <candidate-id>
```

Otherwise list what is waiting:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/si" show-candidate
```

If nothing is waiting and the user invoked this directly, force a review of the
current turn:

```bash
echo '{"session_id":"<session id>","cwd":"<cwd>"}' \
  | "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/si" improve --focus "<what the user asked about>"
```

That runs the same isolated reviewer the automatic path uses. If it returns
`no_signal` or `no_lesson`, tell the user plainly that this turn produced
nothing worth keeping and stop. Proposing nothing is a good outcome, and it is
the most common one.

Hold to the same bar the reviewer uses: a lesson is worth keeping only if it
would have changed what you did earlier in this session, it will still be true
in three months, and you can name the specific evidence for it.

## 2. Find the owner

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/si" find-owners --query "<owner_query from the candidate>"
```

This returns only paths the mutator will accept. Read the most promising ones
before choosing — ownership is a judgment about content, not filename.

Choose in this order, and stop at the first that fits:

1. **Patch the artifact already loaded** that covers this topic.
2. **Patch an existing umbrella** covering the class of thing the lesson is about.
3. **Add or patch a linked reference** owned by such an umbrella.
4. **Create a new skill** — only when no existing artifact plausibly owns it.

Creating a new file is the last resort, not the default. A pile of
single-purpose files is worse than a well-placed paragraph.

Scope: `project` when the lesson is true of this repository, `user` when it is
true of how this person works everywhere. Prefer `project` when torn.

## 3. Draft the exact bytes

Read the target in full. Write the complete new contents of the file, matching
its existing structure, heading style, and voice. Add the smallest thing that
carries the lesson — usually one bullet or one short paragraph.

Do not reformat unrelated lines, reorder sections, or fix unrelated problems you
notice. The diff the user reviews should contain only the lesson.

## 4. Stage it

Pass the complete new contents on standard input. Do not write them to a file
first — you have no tool that can write files, and that is deliberate.

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/si" stage-proposal \
  --target "<absolute path>" \
  --candidate "<candidate-id>" \
  --reason "<one sentence on why this artifact owns the lesson>" <<'SELF_IMPROVE_EOF'
<the complete new file contents>
SELF_IMPROVE_EOF
```

Use a quoted heredoc marker so nothing in the content is expanded by the shell.
The bytes staged are exactly the bytes between the markers.

## 5. Present it

Show the command's output to the user **verbatim**, including the diff and the
two commands at the end. Do not summarize the diff, restate the hash, or
paraphrase the destination.

Then stop. The proposal is inert until the user types the apply command
themselves. Do not invoke `si apply-proposal` — an authorization exists only for
a command the user typed, so calling it yourself will simply fail.
