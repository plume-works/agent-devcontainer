"""
Where a live run puts everything it produces.

Every check that drives a real session leaves a scratch repository, isolated
plugin state, and a raw terminal stream behind, and all of it has to still be
there afterwards. The path used to depend only on the test's name, so it was the
same on every run of every target: ``make smoke`` and ``make wake`` overwrote
each other, and ``make wake-repeat`` destroyed nine of its ten runs on the way to
the tenth — the one target whose whole purpose is comparing runs.

So each *process* claims its own directory under ``test-runs/``, named for the
target that started it, and nothing ever writes where another run has written.

Kept apart from ``conftest.py`` because ``make clean-claude`` runs it as a
program rather than as a fixture.
