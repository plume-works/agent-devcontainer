"""
A pseudo-terminal driver for a real interactive Claude Code session.

Spec-0002. This exists for one observation that no headless session can make:
an ``asyncRewake`` hook waking a session that is sitting idle. A ``-p`` session
finishes at ``result`` and has no idle state to wake into, so the wake has to be
watched in a terminal — either by a person, or by this.

The rules the spec sets for what may be believed here are followed strictly:

- everything that can be asserted from plugin state is asserted from plugin
  state, not from the screen;
- exactly one thing is matched on screen, the candidate identifier, which the
  plugin generates and this harness reads from disk before looking for it; and
- nothing the interface owns — prose, boxes, spinners, colors — is matched at
  all, including to decide when a turn has ended.

Turn boundaries come from quiescence rather than from recognizing a prompt:
while Claude works, the renderer emits continuously; when it stops, the stream
goes quiet. That is a property of a terminal program redrawing, not of any
particular version's layout.

    The failure this exists for is not a wrong assertion, it is a check that

    was sent, whether anything was read afterwards, which wait it is inside —
    and it has to say it while it is still stalling rather than in a post-mortem
    three minutes later.

    Three streams, each with a different job:

    - ``event`` lines to stdout, the readable narrative of the run;
    - ``echo`` lines, the flattened screen after each step, which is what shows
      whether input the harness typed was actually captured by the session; and
    - a raw transcript file, every byte the pty produced, escape sequences
      included, for when the flattened view is not enough.

    Off by nothing: tracing costs nothing measurable and these checks are opt-in
