"""
A fake interactive session, for debugging the harness rather than the plugin.

The pty harness types blind: it never reads the screen to decide anything, so
when a live check stalls there are two very different explanations and no way to
tell them apart from the trace alone. Either the session under test did not do
what was asked, or the harness never delivered the input in the first place —
wrong line ending, a turn that swallowed the next prompt, a dialog nobody
answered.

This program answers the second question on its own. It behaves like an
interactive program on a terminal and nothing else: it draws a banner, echoes
every line it captures with a visible marker, redraws for a moment so the
quiescence detector has something to detect, and exits on ``/exit``. Drive it
with the same script that drives a real session and every step of the harness —
line endings, turn boundaries, the on-screen match, clean exit — is exercised
with no model, no cost, and no interface that can change underneath it.

It can also be told to emit a marker some seconds after a turn ends, with
nothing typed, which is the shape of the wake itself.

Usage::

    python -m tests.smoke.echo_terminal [--wake-after SECONDS] [--wake-text TEXT]
