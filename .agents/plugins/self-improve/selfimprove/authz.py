"""
One-time authorization derived from a literal user command (spec section 5.2).

A candidate is inert until the user types a command naming it and its displayed
hash prefix. That typing is observed by the ``UserPromptExpansion`` hook, which
is the only path that creates a record here.

The distinction this module exists to enforce: Claude invoking the same skill
through the ``Skill`` tool produces no ``UserPromptExpansion`` event, so it
cannot authorize anything. Neither can a generic "looks good" in conversation.
