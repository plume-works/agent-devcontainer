Bounded event capture (spec sections 5.1, 5.3, 5.4).

ephemeral: it holds the current turn's events, is mode 0600, expires within the

Capture is deterministic and cheap. No model is consulted, no transcript is
read, and every failure path is silent — a capture bug must not cost the user
their completed work.
