"""
The Stop-hook orchestration (spec section 5.5).

Runs in the background under ``asyncRewake``, so the user's response is never
delayed by it. The exit code is the whole interface: 0 means stay silent, 2
means wake the session with the message on stderr.

Every step is allowed to decide nothing happens. Most turns end at the gate,
having cost one file read.
