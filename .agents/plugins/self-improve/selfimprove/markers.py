"""
Detecting retention requests, corrections, and confirmations in a prompt.

Deliberately a phrase match rather than a model call: the gate has to be cheap
enough to run on every turn, and a false positive here costs only a discarded
review. Patterns live in ``markers.json`` so they can be tuned and tested as
data.

A marker is permission to reflect, never proof that a lesson exists.
