The deterministic meaningful-event gate (spec section 6).

Nothing here consults a model. The gate decides whether a turn is worth paying
for a review, and its default answer is no. Suppressors are checked before
signals, because a reason not to review is always decisive.

A signal is permission to reflect, not proof that a durable lesson exists. The
reviewer may and often should still return nothing.
